# KeepTime
KeepTime is an enterprise-oriented collaborative time tracker.
It is composed by two parts: an Android application and a [Rails server](https://github.com/aserpi/msecs-macc-server).

## Server
The server acts both as an API backed for the app and as a control panel for system administrators.
Admins can create and modify employees, workspaces, clients, projects and activities and check the current cost for each element.

## App
The application is for exclusive use of workers.
They can change their bill rate and add new schedule items.
Project masters can also create and modify new tasks and assign workers to them.
